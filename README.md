# Road Accident Analysis (Excel Project)

### Project Overview:
This project analyzes **Road Accident Data** using Microsoft **Excel** to identify the key factors that contribute to road casualties. It explores accident trends, casualty severity, and the relationship between road conditions, vehicle types, and locations. The analysis helps to understand high-risk areas and supports better road-safety planning.

### Datast Used:
- <a href="https://github.com/Bsbiswal231/Road-Accident-Data-Analysis/blob/main/Road%20Accident%20Data.xlsb"> Road Accident Data </a>

### Questions (KPIs) / Requirement:

- Primary KPI – Total casualties recorded after the accident.
- Primary KPIs – Total casualties and percentage of total with respect to accident severity and maximum casualties by type of vehicle.
- Secondary KPI – Total casualties with respect to vehicle type.
- Monthly Trend – Comparison of casualties between the current year and previous year.
- Maximum Casualties by Road Type – Identify which road type has the highest number of casualties.
- Distribution of Total Casualties by Road Surface – Analyze accident frequency on dry, wet, or snow-covered roads.
- Relation Between Casualties by Area/Location and Day/Night – Compare accident trends by urban/rural area and by light condition (daylight vs dark).

### Process:

#### 1. Data Collection:🠺
- Imported the Road Accident dataset in Excel format (.xlsb).
- Reviewed columns such as accident severity, vehicle type, road surface, area/location, and light condition to understand the structure and relationships.
#### 2. Data Cleaning :🠺
- Removed duplicate and blank records.
- Fixed spelling errors and standardized field names.
- Formatted data types properly (dates, text, numbers).
- Ensured consistency in categorical data like “Urban/Rural” or “Day/Night”.
 #### 3. Data Preparation:🠺
- Created calculated columns using Excel formulas for aggregation and comparison.
- Built Pivot Tables to summarize the data by vehicle type, road type, surface condition, and area.
- Filtered and arranged data to support visual analysis and dashboard creation.
#### 4. Data Analysis:🠺
- Analyzed accident trends by time period (monthly/yearly).
- Compared results across multiple factors such as surface condition, light condition, and area type.
- Identified peak accident periods and key contributing factors.
#### 5. Dashboard Development:🠺
- Designed an interactive Excel dashboard using PivotCharts, slicers, and filters.
- Added visuals for total casualties, accident trends, and area-wise distribution.
-Ensured the layout was clean, color-coded, and easy to interpret.
#### 6. Insights Generation:🠺
- Observed the major causes and contributing factors to accidents.
- Highlighted actionable findings useful for improving road safety and awareness.
