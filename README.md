# Road Accident Analysis (Excel Project)

### Project Overview:
This project analyzes **Road Accident Data** using Microsoft **Excel** to identify the key factors that contribute to road casualties. It explores accident trends, casualty severity, and the relationship between road conditions, vehicle types, and locations. The analysis helps to understand high-risk areas and supports better road-safety planning.

### Datast Used:

(2.) Primary KPIs – Total casualties and percentage of total with respect to accident severity and maximum casualties by type of vehicle.
(3.) Secondary KPI – Total casualties with respect to vehicle type.
(4.) Monthly Trend – Comparison of casualties between the current year and previous year.
(5.) Maximum Casualties by Road Type – Identify which road type has the highest number of casualties.
(6.) Distribution of Total Casualties by Road Surface – Analyze accident frequency on dry, wet, or snow-covered roads.
(7.) Relation Between Casualties by Area/Location and Day/Night – Compare accident trends by urban/rural area and by light condition (daylight vs dark).
